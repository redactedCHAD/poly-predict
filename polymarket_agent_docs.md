Polymarket Prediction Agent

What It Does
Monitors Polymarket in real-time via WebSocket, collects large trades, uses AI swarm to predict market outcomes, and identifies the TOP 5 consensus picks.

Watches live trades over $100 (configurable)
Filters out crypto, sports, and near-resolution markets
Analyzes markets with 6 AI models in parallel (swarm mode)
Identifies top 5 strongest consensus picks using Claude 4.5
Displays consensus picks with blue background for easy spotting
Saves all data to 3 CSV files for historical tracking and analysis
Quick Start
# Make sure you're in the right environment
conda activate tflow

# Run the agent
python src/agents/polymarket_agent.py
Configuration
All settings are at the top of polymarket_agent.py for easy customization:

Basic Settings
MIN_TRADE_SIZE_USD = 100              # Only track trades over this amount ($1000 for whales)
LOOKBACK_HOURS = 24                    # Historical data on startup
NEW_MARKETS_FOR_ANALYSIS = 25          # Trigger AI after this many new markets
ANALYSIS_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 300  # Check every 5 minutes
MARKETS_TO_ANALYZE = 25                # Number of recent markets to send to AI
USE_SWARM_MODE = True                  # Use 6 AI models (or single model)
TOP_MARKETS_COUNT = 5                  # How many top consensus picks to show
AI Prompts (🌙 Customize for Your Own Edge!)
MARKET_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """..."""      # Prompt for individual AI models
CONSENSUS_AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """..."""       # Prompt for consensus AI
These prompts are your edge! Modify them to:

Change analysis criteria (technical, fundamental, sentiment)
Add market-specific knowledge
Adjust risk tolerance
Focus on specific market types
Category Filters
IGNORE_CRYPTO_KEYWORDS - Skip BTC, ETH, SOL markets
IGNORE_SPORTS_KEYWORDS - Skip NBA, NFL, UFC markets
How It Works
3 Parallel Threads:

WebSocket Thread - Collects trades in real-time, saves to CSV silently
Status Thread - Prints stats every 30 seconds (trades, filters, markets)
Analysis Thread - Checks every 5 minutes for new markets, runs AI when threshold hit
AI Analysis:

First run: Analyzes whatever markets exist
Subsequent runs: Waits for 25 NEW markets before analyzing again
Analyzes the 25 most recent markets each time
Swarm mode: Claude, OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, DeepSeek, XAI (all run in parallel)
Output Files
src/data/polymarket/
├── markets.csv          - All markets with trades over $100
├── predictions.csv      - All 25 market predictions per analysis run
└── consensus_picks.csv  - 🌙 ONLY the top 5 consensus picks (append-only)
markets.csv (All Discovered Markets)
Tracks every unique market from trades over your threshold.

Columns: timestamp, market_id, event_slug, title, outcome, price, size_usd, first_seen

predictions.csv (Detailed Analysis Results)
One row per market analyzed (25 markets per run).

Columns:

analysis_timestamp, analysis_run_id - When and which run
market_title, market_slug, market_link - Market details
Individual predictions: claude_prediction, openai_prediction, groq_prediction, gemini_prediction, deepseek_prediction, xai_prediction
consensus_prediction - Overall consensus (e.g., "YES (83%)")
num_models_responded - How many AIs successfully responded
consensus_picks.csv (🌙 Top Consensus Picks - Your Trading List!)
APPEND-ONLY - Builds history throughout the day. Contains ONLY the top 5 strongest consensus picks from each analysis run.

Columns:

timestamp, run_id - When this pick was made
rank - 1-5 (position in top 5)
market_number - Market number from analysis
market_title - Full market name
side - YES, NO, or NO_TRADE
consensus - "5 out of 6 models agreed"
consensus_count - 5 (how many agreed)
total_models - 6 (total models that responded)
link - Direct Polymarket URL
reasoning - Why this is a strong pick
Perfect for:

Finding markets with repeated strong consensus over time
Analyzing which markets keep appearing in top picks
Building automated trading signals from AI agreement
Reviewing the best opportunities throughout the day
Example: If running every 5 minutes for 24 hours = 288 runs × 5 picks = 1,440 consensus picks tracked!

AI Analysis Flow
Step 1: Swarm Analysis (6 Models in Parallel)
USE_SWARM_MODE = True  # Default
Models Used:

Claude (Anthropic)
OpenAI (GPT)
Groq (Qwen)
Gemini (Google)
DeepSeek
XAI (Grok)
OpenRouter (Gemini/GLM as backup)
Each model gets 120 seconds to respond. If one times out, the others continue - partial results are always used!

Each AI provides: YES, NO, or NO_TRADE decision for each of the 25 markets

Step 2: Consensus AI (Claude 4.5 Sonnet)
After all individual AIs respond, a consensus AI analyzes all responses to identify the TOP 5 markets with strongest agreement.

Consensus AI evaluates:

Which markets have the most AI models agreeing
Ignores split opinions
Focuses on clear, strong agreement (e.g., 5 out of 6 agree on YES)
Ranks by consensus strength
Output: TOP 5 CONSENSUS PICKS displayed with BLUE BACKGROUND 🏆

Single Model Mode (Alternative)
USE_SWARM_MODE = False
AI_MODEL_PROVIDER = "xai"
AI_MODEL_NAME = "grok-2-fast-reasoning"
Faster, cheaper, single perspective - no consensus analysis.

Advanced Usage
Running 24/7 for Maximum Insights
Let the agent run continuously to build a powerful dataset:

# Run in background (on Linux/Mac)
nohup python src/agents/polymarket_agent.py > polymarket.log 2>&1 &

# Or use screen/tmux for persistent sessions
screen -S polymarket
python src/agents/polymarket_agent.py
# Ctrl+A, D to detach
What you'll get after 24 hours:

~288 analysis runs (every 5 minutes)
~1,440 consensus picks tracked
Historical view of market sentiment shifts
Patterns of repeated high-consensus markets
Building Trading Signals
Use consensus_picks.csv to find the best opportunities:

import pandas as pd

# Load consensus picks
df = pd.read_csv('src/data/polymarket/consensus_picks.csv')

# Find markets that appear in top 5 multiple times
repeated_picks = df.groupby('market_title').size()
hot_markets = repeated_picks[repeated_picks >= 3]  # Appeared 3+ times

# Find unanimous picks (all models agreed)
unanimous = df[df['consensus_count'] == df['total_models']]

# Filter by side
strong_yes = df[(df['side'] == 'YES') & (df['consensus_count'] >= 5)]
Customizing Analysis
Example: Focus on political markets

# Edit MARKET_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT
MARKET_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a political prediction expert.
Focus heavily on:
- Policy implications
- Historical precedents
- Political incentives
- Timing around elections

For each market..."""
Example: More conservative (only trade 6/6 consensus)

TOP_MARKETS_COUNT = 3  # Only show top 3

# Edit CONSENSUS_AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE
# Add: "Only include markets where ALL models agree..."
Troubleshooting
Q: Some AI models timing out?

Increase timeout: Edit MODEL_TIMEOUT = 120 in swarm_agent.py to 180
Some models (Gemini) can be slow on complex prompts
Agent continues with partial results - this is expected behavior
Q: Too many markets being analyzed?

Increase NEW_MARKETS_FOR_ANALYSIS = 50 to analyze less frequently
Increase MIN_TRADE_SIZE_USD = 1000 to only track large trades
Q: Not enough markets?

Decrease MIN_TRADE_SIZE_USD = 50 to track more markets
Remove sports/crypto filters by commenting out keywords
Q: Want to backtest my custom prompts?

Keep original consensus_picks.csv as ground truth
Modify prompts, run on historical markets.csv
Compare consensus picks to actual market resolutions
Notes
NO ACTUAL TRADING - This is analysis only (no money at risk)
WebSocket runs 24/7 with auto-reconnect on disconnect
CSV files grow over time - markets.csv can get large (compress old data)
First analysis runs immediately if markets exist in database
Each run gets unique ID - timestamp format (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
Predictions saved with full breakdown - all individual AI responses
Consensus picks append-only - never overwrites, builds history
Market links always included - click straight to Polymarket
API Cost Estimation
Running continuously with swarm mode:

Per analysis: ~6 models × 25 markets × 100 tokens = ~$0.10
Per day: 288 runs × $0.10 = ~$28.80/day
Cost reduction: Use cheaper models (Groq, DeepSeek are nearly free)

Latest Update: Added consensus AI, top 5 picks display, append-only CSV tracking, customizable prompts, and graceful partial response handling.
